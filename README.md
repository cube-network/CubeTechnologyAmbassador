# Cube Technology Ambassador Program

The Cube Tech Ambassador event is the first event planned by the cube community. It represents the entire cube technology community, and we hope that through the cube tech ambassador channel, people will learn about the underlying technology core of cube, and also hope that through the influence of the cube tech ambassador, people will learn more about the entire cube ecosystem, so that they can motivate each other to learn, exchange and progress.
